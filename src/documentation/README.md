### problems

Wanted to underline specific anchor link when scrolling to that portion of the
page. Used percentages of screen height and boundingRect values from elements
to compare each section and determine if it fit within the viewport at which
point a class would be added or removed. Had to tweak values to other than 0
to get it to work the way that I wanted to.
